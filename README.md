# RAG-with-LLMs

This repository implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach leveraging advanced Language Models (LLMs). RAG combines the power of pre-trained LLMs with efficient information retrieval, enabling context-aware and coherent content generation.

## Features

- **RAG Model:** Implement a RAG model that combines a language model for generation and a retriever for content retrieval.
- **Language Models Integration:** Incorporate state-of-the-art language models, such as BERT, GPT, or others, for powerful text generation.
- **Efficient Retrieval:** Utilize an efficient retriever to gather relevant context from large document collections.
- **Customization:** Easily adapt the RAG model and language models for specific use cases and domains.
